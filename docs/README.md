# HolographiX Docs

This directory is the versioned manual and contract for this repository. If a reader
checks out a commit, everything in `docs/` must match what exists in `src/`.

Structure:
- `spec/`   Protocol and file format contracts (wire/file details).
- `guides/` How to run what is implemented today (commands, flags, workflows).
- `kernel/` Local behavior and policies that exist in code today.
- `vision/` Stable, release-level narrative (not weekly notes).

The Wiki is the scratchpad: roadmap, long notes, moving ideas, and drafts.
If it is not implemented in `src/`, it does not belong here.
