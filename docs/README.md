# HolographiX Docs

This directory is the versioned manual and contract for this repository. If a reader
checks out a commit, everything in `docs/` must match what exists in `src/`.

Structure:
- [`docs/guides/`](https://github.com/ciaoidea/HolographiX/tree/V3.0/docs/guides) How to run what is implemented today (commands, flags, workflows).
- [`docs/kernel/`](https://github.com/ciaoidea/HolographiX/tree/V3.0/docs/kernel) Local behavior and policies that exist in code today.
- [`docs/spec/`](https://github.com/ciaoidea/HolographiX/tree/V3.0/docs/spec) Protocol and file format contracts (wire/file details).
- [`docs/vision/`](https://github.com/ciaoidea/HolographiX/tree/V3.0/docs/vision) Stable, release-level narrative (not weekly notes).

Kernel highlights:
- [`docs/kernel/stacking.md`](https://github.com/ciaoidea/HolographiX/blob/V3.0/docs/kernel/stacking.md) Gauge alignment behavior for v3 stacking.

The Wiki is the scratchpad: roadmap, long notes, moving ideas, and drafts.
If it is not implemented in `src/`, it does not belong here.
